# Cryptology2

A revised version of Cryptology bot - originally founded and developed by Chris Hardin in 2020/21 but revised and picked up in 2024 by Temirkulov, with permission from the original creator.

This bot is developed using Javascript using the Discord.js 14 library. While the original version was built around message commands, this **Revised** Version is built around Interaction Commands which is up-to-date with Discord's latest bot demands.
